# ObjCToCppTranslator
This project is intended to translate Objective C code to CPP.  The aim is not to translate to 100% accuracy but do 90-95% of the work and rest can be done manually!

This project mainly translates Objective C code based out of Cocos2d to Cocos2dX.  A lot of harcoding is there in the main class but can be easily changed for your requirements.
